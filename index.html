<p class="mb-0"><p>Wikipedia information about Roll-off dumpster</p>

<p> </p>

<p><br />
The main purpose of a dumpster is to store garbage until it is emptied by a garbage truck for disposal. Dumpsters can be used for all kinds of waste, or for recycling purposes.</p>

<p>Most dumpsters are emptied by front-loading garbage trucks. These trucks have large prongs on the front which are aligned and inserted into arms or slots on the dumpster. Hydraulics lift the prongs and the dumpster, eventually flipping the dumpster upside-down and emptying its contents into the garbage truck&#39;s hopper (storage compartment). Other dumpsters are smaller and are emptied by rear-loading trucks. Dumpsters are typically emptied outside of peak traffic hours. The frequency at which dumpsters are emptied varies from community to community, often ranging from daily to weekly, depending on the volume of trash generated.<br />
